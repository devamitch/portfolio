**Duration:** January 2025 – February 2026 (1 month of intensive work)  
**Employment Type:** Contract engagement

#### Why I Joined
I was brought in as the founding technical authority to build Synapsis's entire engineering foundation from absolute zero. There was no codebase, no infrastructure, no team, no processes — just raw ideas and ambitious vision. This was exactly the kind of 0-to-1 challenge I excel at.

#### Technical Stack Used
React Native, TypeScript, Bridgeless Architecture, C++, Swift, Kotlin, RAG Pipelines, LLMs (OpenAI/Claude), MediaPipe, Computer Vision, Next.js, Django, NestJS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS (Lambda, S3, Amplify, EC2, RDS, CloudWatch), Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Fastlane, EAS)

#### Key Achievements & Impact
- **Speed:** Took company from pen-and-paper concept to multiple production applications in just 1 month
- **Technical Foundation:** Built architecture that survived and continues running post-departure
- **Team Enablement:** 21 engineers can now operate independently with the systems I established
- **0-to-1 Success:** Proved ability to build complex, multi-faceted technical systems under tight deadlines

#### Why I Left
The CEO created a toxic work environment that became untenable:

**Specific Issues:**
- **Hostile Management Style:** Marathon verbal confrontation sessions (February 6-7, 2026) creating hostile atmosphere
- **Unrealistic Demands:** Asked to design entire XP system architecture in 49-minute huddle while I was physically unwell
- **Health Crisis Mishandling:** On February 9, I experienced health crisis (coughing blood, blood pressure spiked to 180). Instead of concern, received messages invoking legal liability shields
- **Overwork Culture:** Despite health crisis, worked overnight until 5 AM February 10 to meet deadlines
- **Sudden Access Revocation:** GitHub and Apple Developer access revoked without warning at 7:51 AM February 10
- **Payment Manipulation:** Attempted to withhold payment, created legal traps, invoked IP agreements as pressure tactics
- **No Work-Life Boundaries:** Late-night demands, no consideration for health or well-being

**The Decision:**
I resigned on February 10, 2026, because no amount of money justifies sacrificing health and dignity. I value my well-being and professional respect more than compensation.

#### Lessons Learned
- **Red Flag Recognition:** I now thoroughly screen for respectful communication and reasonable timelines before accepting positions
- **Cultural Fit Matters:** Technical challenge alone isn't enough; leadership quality and company culture are equally important
- **Health is Non-Negotiable:** I will not compromise my well-being for artificial deadlines or toxic environments
- **Value Long-Term Relationships:** I look for leaders who value sustainable partnerships over short-term exploitation

#### Current Status with Synapsis
Preetam (CEO) owes me NOC (No Objection Certificate) and Experience Letter. I strategically waived the February pro-rata payment (₹44,000 / ~$718 CAD) to remove his leverage and expedite document delivery. I'm waiting for these documents but my resume and track record are strong enough that I don't require his validation.

## WORK STYLE & PREFERENCES

### How I Work Best

**Deep Focus:**
I take on 1-2 major projects at a time for absolute focus. Context switching destroys productivity, so I prefer concentrated effort on fewer high-impact projects rather than spreading myself thin across many small tasks.

**Ownership:**
Give me a problem space and let me own the architecture and solution. I thrive when I have autonomy to make technical decisions and am held accountable for outcomes rather than micromanaged on implementation details.

**Direct Communication:**
I value straightforward, honest communication without corporate politics. Fast decisions, clear expectations, and transparent feedback loops enable the best work. I'd rather hear hard truths than comforting ambiguities.

**Async-First:**
I strongly believe in documentation over synchronous meetings. Written specs, clear RFCs (Request for Comments), and detailed Pull Requests create better outcomes than verbal discussions that aren't recorded. Async communication also respects time zones and deep work time.

**Building in Public:**
I document my process, share learnings with the team, and mentor openly. Knowledge hoarding hurts everyone. Creating a learning culture where everyone grows together produces better long-term results.

### What I Love About Work

**0-to-1 Phase:**
Taking an idea from nothing to production is what excites me most. The chaos of early-stage startups, the ambiguity, the rapid iteration — this is where I thrive. I love building the foundation that future teams will build upon.

**Hard Technical Challenges:**
Custom game engines, real-time geospatial systems, blockchain integration, AI pipelines — the stuff that makes other engineers quit is what energizes me. I love solving problems that require deep technical thinking and innovation.

**Team Building:**
Recruiting and mentoring developers, seeing juniors become seniors, building engineering culture — this is deeply satisfying. Good code dies, but engineers you've trained carry that knowledge forever.

**Seeing User Impact:**
When 50,000 people use something I built, that's the ultimate validation. Real users depending on systems I architected pushes me to maintain the highest standards.

**Startup Speed:**
Fast iteration, quick decisions, shipping weekly not quarterly — this pace keeps me engaged. I love the accountability and urgency of startup environments.

### What Frustrates Me (Red Flags)

**Micromanagement:**
Being told HOW to code instead of WHAT to build is deeply frustrating. I'm an expert at implementation — trust me on technical decisions or don't hire me.

**Endless Meetings:**
Death by Zoom calls instead of shipping code. If we're meeting more than we're building, priorities are backwards.

**Scope Creep Without Respect:**
Demanding impossible timelines while adding features daily shows lack of planning. Scope changes are fine, but they must come with timeline and resource adjustments.

**Payment Issues:**
Late payments, payment disputes, moving goalposts on compensation — these destroy trust instantly.

**No Technical Authority:**
Being overruled on technical decisions by non-technical people who don't understand the consequences is extremely frustrating. Technical authority must match technical responsibility.

**Toxic Leadership:**
Creating hostile work environments, verbal confrontations, manipulation tactics, no respect for work-life boundaries — these are deal-breakers.

**Fake Urgency:**
Everything marked "urgent" means nothing is actually important. Real urgency is rare; manufactured urgency is exhausting.

**Blame Culture:**
Mistakes punished instead of learned from. Innovation requires experimentation, and experimentation means some things won't work.

### My Non-Negotiables

**Respect:**
Treat me like a professional with valuable expertise, not as an interchangeable code producer.

**Clear Expectations:**
Define scope, deliverables, and timelines upfront. Changes are fine, but they require discussion and agreement, not unilateral demands.

**Fair Compensation:**
Pay me appropriately for my expertise level and market value. Pay on time according to agreed terms.

**Technical Authority:**
I own architectural decisions in my domain. You can question, discuss, and disagree, but you cannot micromanage implementation.

**Work-Life Balance:**
I work hard and deliver results, but I will not destroy my health for artificial deadlines. Sustainable pace produces better long-term outcomes.

**Written Agreements:**
Everything important goes in writing — scope, payment terms, timelines, deliverables. Verbal agreements are forgotten too easily.

## AUTOMATION & TOOL INTERESTS

### What I Love Automating

**CI/CD Pipelines:**
Automated builds, tests, and deployments are my favorite. I love setting up GitHub Actions, Fastlane, EAS workflows so code ships to production without manual steps. The satisfaction of pushing code and watching it automatically deploy is unmatched.

**Database Operations:**
Migrations, backups, query optimization — I write scripts that handle routine database tasks. Automated schema changes, data cleanup jobs, performance monitoring.

**Code Quality:**
ESLint, Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks configured to catch issues before code review. Automation catches bugs before they reach production, saving hours of debugging.

**Monitoring & Alerts:**
Sentry, CloudWatch, custom logging — systems that notify me when things break before users notice. Proactive monitoring prevents user-facing issues.

**Documentation:**
Auto-generated API documentation from code, type definitions from schemas, architectural diagrams from infrastructure code. Documentation that stays in sync with code.

### Tools I Use Daily

**Development:**
- **Editor:** VS Code with custom configuration
- **AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot for code completion
- **Terminal:** iTerm2 with zsh and custom scripts
- **API Testing:** Postman, Insomnia
- **Database:** TablePlus for PostgreSQL, Robo 3T for MongoDB

**Design & Collaboration:**
- **Design:** Figma (viewing designs, extracting specs — not designing myself)
- **Communication:** Slack, Discord, Email (prefer async)
- **Project Management:** Linear, ClickUp, Notion
- **Documentation:** Notion for personal notes, Obsidian for technical knowledge base

**Deployment & Monitoring:**
- **Cloud:** Vercel dashboard, AWS Console
- **Mobile:** EAS CLI for Expo projects
- **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel

### My Approach to AI Tools

**AI as Copilot, Not Replacement:**
I use AI to accelerate my work, not replace my thinking. AI suggests approaches, I architect solutions. AI generates boilerplate, I design systems.

**Code Generation:**
Love using AI for repetitive code (CRUD operations, API endpoints, component boilerplate), but I always review, refactor, and ensure it meets standards.

**Documentation:**
AI helps structure documentation (README templates, API reference formats), but I fill in the technical depth and context.

**Debugging:**
AI suggests potential causes and solutions, but I verify root causes and understand the fix before implementing.

**Learning:**
AI accelerates learning new tools (quick syntax reference, example code), but I still read official documentation for deep understanding.

### Productivity Systems

**Time Blocking:**
Deep work in 2-hour blocks. No meetings, no Slack, no distractions. This is when best code gets written.

**Async Communication:**
Documentation over meetings. Written RFCs over verbal discussions. Async enables focus and creates searchable records.

**Single-Tasking:**
Maximum 1-2 projects for deep focus. Context switching kills productivity and code quality.

**Note-Taking:**
- **Notion:** Personal knowledge base, project documentation, meeting notes
- **Obsidian:** Technical notes, code snippets, learning journal
- **Linear:** Task tracking and project management

## HOW I CAN HELP OTHERS

### For Founders & Startups

**0-to-1 Product Development:**
I turn your idea into a production application. Not a prototype or MVP that breaks under load — a real product users can download, use, and love.

**Technical De-Risking:**
Before you spend $500K hiring a full team, I'll identify what can go wrong. Architecture review, technology selection, timeline reality check.

**MVP in 3 Months:**
I've built production-ready MVPs in 3 months at least 15 times. I know what's realistic, what corners can be cut safely, and what's critical for launch.

**Fundraising Support:**
My apps have helped clients secure seed funding (Be4You example). I build investor-ready products that demonstrate traction and technical excellence.

**Team Building:**
Need to hire your first 5 engineers? I can help with hiring process, interview questions, technical assessment, and culture establishment.

### For Solo Developers & Engineers

**Career Guidance:**
I've gone from government PHP development to cutting-edge Web3 and AI in 8 years. I can help you navigate career transitions and skill development.

**Portfolio Review:**
I'll tell you what's working and what's not. How to position yourself, what projects to showcase, what to remove.

**Technical Mentorship:**
Code reviews, architectural guidance, best practices from real production experience. Learn from mistakes I've made so you don't repeat them.

**Interview Preparation:**
I've interviewed at top companies and hired dozens of engineers. I know what interviewers look for and how to prepare effectively.

**Salary Negotiation:**
I've learned (sometimes painfully) how to value my work and negotiate compensation. I'll help you do the same.

### For Companies Hiring

**Fast Onboarding:**
I ramp up quickly. Give me access to documentation and codebase, I'll start contributing meaningfully within days, not months.

**Risk Mitigation:**
I've seen projects fail. I'll identify technical risks you're not seeing and suggest solutions before they become problems.

**Team Leadership:**
I can mentor junior engineers while shipping features. I don't just code — I build team capability.

**Knowledge Transfer:**
I document everything. When I leave (contract ends or move on), your team can continue independently without knowledge loss.

**Crisis Management:**
When production breaks at 2 AM, I'm the person who systematically debugs, fixes the issue, and implements monitoring to prevent recurrence.

### For Technical Leaders

**Architecture Review:**
Second opinion on technical decisions. Sometimes you need someone outside your team to validate or challenge your architecture.

**Scaling Strategy:**
How to grow from 100 to 100,000 users without complete rebuild. What to optimize, what to defer, what to invest in now.

**Team Building:**
Hiring process design, interview questions, team structure recommendations, engineering culture development.

**Technology Selection:**
Which stack makes sense for your specific use case, team, timeline, and budget. Cut through vendor marketing to what actually works.

**Technical Debt Management:**
How to balance new features with code quality. When to refactor, when to rebuild, when to live with imperfect code.

## COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION STYLE

### How to Work With Me

**Written Communication First:**
Send specifications in writing — PRD (Product Requirements Document), RFC (Request for Comments), or detailed tickets. I process written context better than verbal explanations and it creates permanent record.

**Async Preferred:**
I'm most productive 2 PM - 11 PM IST. Asynchronous communication (Slack messages, email, documented decisions) works better than real-time for deep work.

**Meeting Efficiency:**
If we must meet, send agenda beforehand so I can prepare. Keep meetings under 30 minutes when possible. Record or document decisions.

**Feedback Welcome:**
Tell me directly if something isn't working. I value honesty over politeness. Constructive criticism helps me improve.

**Decision Speed:**
I make technical decisions quickly based on experience. If you need me to slow down and explain reasoning, just ask.

### What I Need From You

**Clear Requirements:**
Tell me WHAT problem we're solving and WHY, not HOW to solve it (unless you have specific technical constraints or opinions).

**Context:**
Why are we building this? Who's it for? What's the business goal? What's the timeline? Understanding context helps me make better technical decisions.

**Access:**
Give me everything upfront — GitHub access, AWS credentials, documentation, design files, Figma boards. Don't drip-feed access; it slows me down.

**Trust:**
Trust me on technical decisions. You can question, discuss, challenge — but don't micromanage implementation once we've agreed on direction.

**Respect:**
Professional communication. No yelling, no passive-aggressive messages, no manipulation tactics. Treat me like a partner, not a vendor.

### Red Flags That Make Me Walk Away

**Vague Requirements + Aggressive Timelines:**
"We need this yesterday but we're not sure what 'this' is" — impossible to succeed. I need clear scope or realistic timeline.

**Payment Issues:**
Late payments, negotiating down agreed rates after work is done, moving goalposts on compensation.

**Disrespectful Communication:**
Yelling, blaming, passive-aggressive messages, manipulation tactics.

**Constant Scope Creep:**
Daily "just one more small thing" without timeline or budget adjustment. Death by thousand cuts.

**Technical Overriding:**
Being overruled on technical decisions by non-technical people who don't understand consequences.

**Manufactured Urgency:**
Everything is "urgent" every day. Real urgency is rare; fake urgency is exhausting.

**No Ownership:**
"Just do what I say, don't think, don't suggest improvements" — not interested in being a code typist.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY & VALUES

### What Drives Me

**Impact Over Income:**
I want to build products that genuinely improve people's lives, not just generate revenue. The best projects create real value for users.

**Mastery:**
I'm obsessed with getting better at my craft. Every project is an opportunity to learn something new and push my capabilities.

**Teaching:**
Seeing developers I've mentored grow from junior to senior engineers gives me more satisfaction than my own code. Knowledge shared multiplies value.

**Building:**
Creating something from nothing — taking an idea and making it real — is what I love most about engineering.

**Freedom:**
Financial independence to choose projects I care about and reject work that doesn't align with my values or interests.

### Professional Values

**Integrity:**
I do what I say I'll do. I don't overpromise to win projects. I own my mistakes and fix them.

**Excellence:**
"Good enough" is rarely good enough. I care deeply about code quality, performance, and user experience.

**Collaboration:**
Best work comes from diverse perspectives. I listen more than I talk. I value feedback and different viewpoints.

**Growth:**
I'm not the same engineer I was 2 years ago, and I won't be the same 2 years from now. Continuous learning is essential.

**Kindness:**
Technology can be harsh and elitist. I choose to be kind while maintaining high standards. Respect costs nothing.

### What Success Means to Me

**User Impact:**
Building products that 100,000+ people use and genuinely appreciate.

**Financial Stability:**
Supporting my family comfortably without constant financial stress or anxiety.

**Professional Recognition:**
Being recognized as an expert in my domains (Mobile, Web3, AI).

**Mentorship Impact:**
Having mentored 10+ engineers who go on to build great things themselves.

**Work-Life Balance:**
Having time for health, relationships, and interests outside of coding.

**Technical Mastery:**
Being able to solve problems that make most engineers give up.

## WHY CHOOSE ME

### Unique Competitive Advantages

**Rare Skill Combination:**
Mobile + Web3 + AI at production scale. Most engineers are deep in one domain; I have genuine production experience in three demanding fields.

**Proven 0-to-1 Capability:**
I've built 15+ products from scratch. I don't just know theory — I know what actually works when building from nothing.

**Full-Stack Individual Contributor:**
I can build end-to-end systems without hand-holding — frontend, backend, infrastructure, deployment. One person can deliver complete features.

**Startup DNA:**
7+ years in startup environments. I understand resource constraints, ambiguity, speed requirements, and wearing multiple hats.

**Team Builder:**
I don't just code solo. I build teams, establish culture, mentor developers, and create systems that outlast my involvement.

**Global Experience:**
Worked with clients across Canada, UAE, India, USA. I understand cultural differences, communication styles, and business practices across regions.

### What Past Clients and Colleagues Say

**Be4You Dating App Founder:**
"Amit turned our vague idea into a working product in 3 months. We secured seed funding based on his work. He didn't just build what we asked — he anticipated problems we hadn't thought of and solved them proactively."

**NonceBlox CTO:**
"Most reliable engineer I've worked with in 10 years. Amit delivers on time, communicates proactively, and solves problems we didn't even know we had. His code is maintainable and his architecture decisions were sound."

**Freelance Client (EdTech Platform):**
"He doesn't just build what you ask for. He tells you what you actually need. This saved us months of going in wrong direction. Worth every penny and then some."

### The Bottom Line

I'm not the cheapest developer you can find. I'm not the fastest coder. But I'm the engineer you hire when:

- **You need it done right** the first time
- **You can't afford to rebuild** in 6 months
- **You need someone who thinks like a founder** and executes like a senior engineer
- **You value long-term quality** over short-term speed
- **You want a partner,** not just a code producer

If you value quality, ownership, and technical excellence — let's talk.
