    summary: `Eight years. Before the LLMs. Before vibe coding. When you had to actually understand the stack, end to end.

I build mobile products that work in production — deeply, natively, efficiently. React Native at its lowest level,game engines, AI pipelines, blockchain integrations, HealthTech architectures. I've led teams, owned delivery, and shipped products that real people depend on.

Senior mobile architect with 8+ years building production applications at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and healthcare. Shipped 13+ apps serving 50,000+ users. Currently leading engineering at HealthTech AI startup, handling principal-level operations including technical strategy, team management, and executive client relationships. Managing 500+ projects across 5 production applications.

I don't generate code. I architect systems.`,

  summary: `Eight years. Before the LLMs. Before vibe coding. When you had to actually understand the stack, end to end.

I build mobile products that work in production — deeply, natively, efficiently. React Native at its lowest level,game engines, AI pipelines, blockchain integrations, HealthTech architectures. I've led teams, owned delivery, and shipped products that real people depend on.

Senior mobile architect with 8+ years building production applications at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and healthcare. Shipped 13+ apps serving 50,000+ users. Currently leading engineering at HealthTech AI startup, handling principal-level operations including technical strategy, team management, and executive client relationships. Managing 500+ projects across 5 production applications.

I don't generate code. I architect systems.`,
