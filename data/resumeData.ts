    summary: `Eight years. Before the LLMs. Before vibe coding. When you had to actually understand the stack, end to end.

I build mobile products that work in production — deeply, natively, efficiently. React Native at its lowest level, custom game engines, AI pipelines, blockchain integrations, HealthTech architectures. I've led teams, owned delivery, and shipped products that real people depend on.

Senior mobile architect with 8+ years building production applications at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and healthcare. Shipped 13+ apps serving 50,000+ users. Currently leading engineering at HealthTech AI startup, handling principal-level operations including technical strategy, team management, and executive client relationships. Managing 500+ projects across 5 production applications.

I don't generate code. I architect systems.`,
